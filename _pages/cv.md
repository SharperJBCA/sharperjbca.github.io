## Research Statement
I am an expert in the field of radio astronomy with more than ten years experience working both on low-level data processing and pipeline development, as well as working with radio data to publish work on the astrophysics of anomalous microwave emission and Galactic synchrotron emission. My current role is within the next generation CMB space mission LiteBIRD where I am one of the joint leaders for the LiteBIRD Galactic science group. I am also a member of several other ground-based CMB and intensity mapping groups that include: QUIJOTE, C-BASS, BINGO, COMAP, and MeerKLASS. A key area I have worked on within these collaborations is the mitigation of systematic errors due to the instrument, ground pick-up, the atmosphere, or, critically for this position, RFI from satellites. I have several published works regarding the impact of RFI on future SKAO observations, and I have presented this work at the Co-existing with RFI workshop.
